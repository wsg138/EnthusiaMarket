# Tasks — EnthusiaMarket

**Date:** 2026-05-24
**Status:** Bootstrap (emitted by `/spear:init`; extend via `/spear:spec`)

Tags: `TDD` (failing test before code), `DOC` (markdown / template authoring), `INFRA` (manifests, CI, repo plumbing).
State legend: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done, `[!]` blocked.

Each task carries `References:` (REQ-IDs + spec sections consulted) and `Evidence:` (sources consulted as work proceeds — an empty block blocks advancement past `spec-done` per REQ-030).

Tasks are ordered to honour state-machine and architectural dependencies. Independent tasks within a milestone may be parallelised.

## Task authoring rules

1. Every task has exactly ONE tag (`TDD`, `DOC`, or `INFRA`).
2. `References:` cites at least one REQ-ID from `requirements.md`. If the REQ doesn't exist, run `/spear:spec` first.
3. `Evidence:` starts empty (```). It must be filled before any skill past `spec-done` will run (REQ-030). Each line is a verified source (e.g. `context7:react@19/useEffect`, `src/domain/Order.kt:42`, `docs/implementation.md#3.1`).
4. Task size ceiling: ~1500 tokens of full briefing. If larger, split.
5. A task MUST be achievable by a single SPEAR cycle (`spec → prove → engine → arch → refine` for TDD; `spec → arch → refine` for DOC/INFRA).
6. Mark state as work proceeds: `[~]` when entering `spec`; `[x]` only when `/spear:refine` has cleared state to `idle`.
